              Digital Matt Album is another great album we are offering our
              brides and grooms. This album comes only in one size 10'x14', but
              it comes with very beautiful white box, what makes this album look
              more mysterious and of course give it extra protection. The
              pictures are printed directly on colored matt boards,we can add
              different frames and textures to every picture, they can be matt
              or raised varnished, what gives them a 3D effect. The pictures
              have a special coating, which protects them from fading. First
              time in digital printing era, you will be able to add translucent
              pages between the pictures, and your album will get old classic
              view. Your own title and one of various covers we offer will
              personalize your memories and make them even more special.

              Digital Young Book is one more great alternative to our Wedding
              Book. When I first saw this album, I was impressed with its
              simplicity, minimalism, but it still looks very elegant and
              modern. The albums comes with the same style rigid box, and you
              can choose same or different material and colors for album and
              box. The cover of the Young Book is thinner and simpler, but
              "Simple is the best" is the best description for this album. We
              are offering Our Young book comes in three different size: 8'x10',
              10'x14' and 14'x18' with minimum 30 pages. The pictures are
              directly printed on the pages, like in all our wedding albums.
